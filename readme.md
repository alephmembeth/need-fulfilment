# Need Fulfilment

This is a repository for a chapter on need fulfilment by Mark Siebel and me.

- The structures of our pilot studies for use with LimeSurvey (version 6.10.2+250127) are available in `/pilot studies`.
- Data can be found in `/analysis`, along with do files for analysis with Stata (version 15.1).
